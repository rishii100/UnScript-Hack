# FoodConnect:
Food Connect aims to reduce food waste and combat hunger by linking surplus food from local sources to those in need. Our platform utilizes technology to create a sustainable and fair food system that benefits the environment and society.

Our goal is to optimize and improve efficiency by collecting and analyzing data to match cost-effective methods to specific area needs. This reduces logistics costs and maximizes our impact in addressing food insecurity.

Our mission is to address critical issues related to food insecurity and environmental sustainability which in turn also generates economic benefits by reducing costs associated with food production and distribution. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses these challenges, with the ultimate goal of creating a better world for all.
